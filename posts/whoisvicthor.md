Hey there!

My name is *Victhor Sart√≥rio*. I was born in a *brazilian town called Vila Velha* (Old Village, in portuguese - current pop. 500k).

I currently live in the city of *Rio de Janeiro* and I work as a *data scientist*.

I have a *bachelors in Statistics from the National School of Statistical Sciences* and an *MSc in Statistics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro*. Unsurprisingly, I really like statistics :)

I *currently work at the Brazilian mobile gaming unicorn Wildlife Studios*, where I'm working really hard with some brilliant people trying to crack some digital advertising challenges.

I am *vegan*, am super into *note-taking apps right now* (I designed this blog to look like my Obsidian app), and like most thing related to *technology, internet and data*, though I also periodically dabble with other interests :)

If you want to, feel free to reach out to me!
